# Database Testing

## What is database testing?

It is the process of testing a database to ensure it meets the required standards. 

It can be split into different types:

1. `Structural`: verifies that the database structure is accurate (schema, tables, keys, indexes, naming conventions, etc).
2. `Functional`: operations (like CRUD) work and queries deliver the correct results.
3. `Non-functional`: ensures that non-functional aspects of the database are covered. This involves `Performance testing` (database behavior under normal and heavy loads, response time, etc); `Security`(how easy to break it is); and `Data integrity`(data is accurate, reliable, and consistent).

SQL knowledge is necessary for `Structural` and `Functional` tests, and recommended for `Performance` but not mandatory.

## Why is database testing important?

It helps ensure that the database works as expected and supports the application it is connected to.
