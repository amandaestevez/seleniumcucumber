### Test Plan for Google Search Feature

#### 1. **Test Plan Identifier**
- Test Plan ID: GSF-TP-001

#### 2. **Introduction**
The purpose of this test plan is to validate the functionality, performance, usability, and security of the Google search feature. The main objective is to ensure that users can effectively search for information, and the search results are accurate, relevant, and presented in a user-friendly manner.

#### 3. **Test Objectives**
- Verify that the Google search feature returns relevant and accurate search results.
- Validate that the search suggestions (autocomplete) are working correctly.
- Ensure that the "I'm Feeling Lucky" button redirects to the most relevant page.
- Confirm that filters (such as Images, Videos, News, etc.) function as expected.
- Test the responsiveness and performance of the search feature across different devices and browsers.

#### 4. **Scope**
- **In Scope**: Testing search query input, search suggestions, result ranking, filters (e.g., Images, News), language settings, and responsiveness across different devices.
- **Out of Scope**: Backend data retrieval algorithms, advertisements, and advanced search features (e.g., operators like "AND", "OR").

#### 5. **Test Approach**
- Manual testing will be performed to validate the basic functionalities and UI of the search page.
- Automation testing will be performed to cover regression scenarios and performance testing.
- Tests will be conducted across various browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and devices (Desktop, Mobile, Tablet).

#### 6. **Test Items**
- Search input box
- Search button
- Search suggestions (autocomplete)
- Search result page
- "I'm Feeling Lucky" button
- Filters (Images, Videos, News, Maps, etc.)

#### 7. **Test Environment**
- **Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest versions)
- **Devices**: Desktop (Windows, macOS), Mobile (Android, iOS), Tablet
- **Network**: Testing under different network conditions (Wi-Fi, 3G, 4G, 5G)

#### 8. **Test Cases**
Test Case Guide
1. Framework: BDD,TDD
   - Tool: Selenium, Cucumber
2. Technique: White, Black, Grey. 
3. Level: Unit, Integration, System, Performance, UAT.
   - Type:

##### **Functional Test Cases**
1. **Search Input Field**
   - **TC001**: Verify that users can enter a query in the search input field.
   - Guide:
   1. Framework: BDD 
        - Tool:
            - LANGUAGE:Java 21, 
              - BUILD: Maven
            - DEPENDENCIES: Cucumber 7.20, Selenium xxxx, JUnit 5, 
            - PLUGINS: Maven Surefire, Maven Compiler.
   2. Technique: White Box
   3. Level: Unit Testing
        - Smoke Testing.
      
   - **TC002**: Verify that hitting "Enter" after entering a query triggers the search.

2. **Search Suggestions (Autocomplete)**
   - **TC003**: Verify that search suggestions are displayed as users type.
   - **TC004**: Verify that clicking on a suggestion populates the search input field.

3. **Search Results**
   - **TC005**: Verify that the search results are relevant to the query.
   - **TC006**: Verify that links in the search results redirect to the appropriate pages.

4. **Filters**
   - **TC007**: Verify that clicking on "Images" shows image results.
   - **TC008**: Verify that clicking on "Videos" shows video results.

5. **"I'm Feeling Lucky" Button**
   - **TC009**: Verify that clicking on the "I'm Feeling Lucky" button redirects to the most relevant page directly.

##### **Usability Test Cases**
- **TC010**: Verify that the search results page is user-friendly and the layout is intuitive.
- **TC011**: Verify that search suggestions are displayed in a non-intrusive manner.

##### **Performance Test Cases**
- **TC012**: Verify that the search results are returned within 2 seconds of submitting a query.
- **TC013**: Verify that the search page loads smoothly under different network conditions.

##### **Security Test Cases**
- **TC014**: Verify that no malicious scripts can be injected into the search query.
- **TC015**: Verify that the search feature is not vulnerable to SQL injection.

#### 9. **Entry and Exit Criteria**
- **Entry Criteria**: 
  - Test environment is set up.
  - All dependencies are available.
- **Exit Criteria**: 
  - All test cases are executed.
  - No critical or major defects remain unresolved.

#### 10. **Test Deliverables**
- Test cases document
- Test results report
- Bug report
- Automation scripts (if applicable)

#### 11. **Risks and Mitigation**
- **Risk**: Inconsistent network conditions may affect performance testing.
- **Mitigation**: Use network simulation tools to emulate different network conditions.
- **Risk**: Changes to the Google search algorithm may affect test results.
  - **Mitigation**: Maintain regular communication with the development team for any updates.
